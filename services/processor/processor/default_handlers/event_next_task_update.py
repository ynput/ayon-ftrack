    """Change status on following Task.

    Handler cares about changes of status id on Task entities. When new status
    has state "Done" it will try to find following task and change it's status.
    It is expected following task should be marked as "Ready to work on".

    By default all tasks with same task type must have state "Done" to do any
    changes. And when all tasks with same task type are "done" it will change
    statuses on all tasks with next task type.

    # Enable
    Handler is based on settings, handler can be turned on/off with "enabled"
    key.
    ```
    "enabled": True
    ```

    # Status mappings
    Must have set mappings of new statuses:
    ```
    "mapping": {
        # From -> To
        "Not Ready": "Ready",
        ...
    }
    ```

    If current status name is not found then status change is skipped.

    # Ignored statuses
    These status names are skipping as they would be in "Done" state. Best
    example is status "Omitted" which in most of cases is "Blocked" state but
    it will never change.
    ```
    "ignored_statuses": [
        "Omitted",
        ...
    ]
    ```

    # Change statuses sorted by task type and by name
    Change behaviour of task type batching. Statuses are not checked and set
    by batches of tasks by Task type but one by one. Tasks are sorted by
    Task type and then by name if all previous tasks are "Done" the following
    will change status.
    ```
    "name_sorting": True
    ```
